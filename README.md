Laravel Project

The first project I've built using a Laravel or a Framework.
It have a SCRUD system for user, moderator and admin's of the page.
Chat in real time.
Beside all that, the main purpose of the webpage was to narrate a story
where the user had to choose "paths", every path leads to another choice
and in the end, leaves the user with a history of all the decisitions he made
with a phrase according to his emotions.
